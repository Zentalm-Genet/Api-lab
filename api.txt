1 Check if the POST request accept params, queries, and/or a body. Which one(s) and what information is it expecting to be sent?

- The POST request for creating a new post typically accepts a body. The body should contain the information of the post being created, such as the text of the post, author information

2 What data type does the GET request return?
  - The GET request typically returns data in JSON format.

3 What would the URL look like for deleting the post with the id 555? (This post does not exist anymore, but the syntax is the same for existing posts, )
  - https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/555

4 List the possible response codes from the GET request at ‘/posts/filter’
   - 200 (OK), 400 (Bad Request), 401 (Unauthorized), 403 (Forbidden), 404 (Not Found), etc

5 Create a post whose text is your name, record the URL and body here:
  
  - URL: https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts
  body: { "text": "Zentalm Genet" }


6 What would the URL and body object be to update the post you just made to contain your faovrite color instead of your name?

  - URL: Assuming the ID of the post you created is 123, the URL   would be: https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/123
Body:

{
  "text": "Blue"
}


7 What is the URL to get posts that contain the text “blue”?
  - URL: https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/filter?text=blue

8 Make a request to GET all the posts. What are the content type and charset of the response? (Hint: look on the Headers)

       -  Content-Type: application/json
       -  Charset: Typically UTF-8

9 What would cause a PUT request to return a 409 status?

    - A PUT request might return a 409 status if there is a     conflict with the current state of the resource being updated. This could happen if there are conflicting changes made to the resource by multiple clients.

10 What happens if you try to send a query in the GET request URL? Why do you get that response?
    - In a GET request, queries are not typically used in the URL. Instead, queries are usually sent in the request parameters or body. If you try to send a query in the GET request URL, you might receive a 400 Bad Request response because the server is expecting parameters to be sent in a different format.
